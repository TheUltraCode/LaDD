Software packages required for LaDD that need to be install on the system:
 * pyserial (latest from pip3)
 * obd (latest from pip3; requires the latest version of pyserial to work correctly)
 * RPi.GPIO (latest from apt-get)
 * python3-numpy (latest from apt-get) or numpy (latest from pip3) (I do not believe it matters; it's your choice)
 * cv2 (OpenCV) (latest version from OpenCV online repository)
 * Pillow (latest from pip3)
 * "tcl" and "tkinter" (latest from apt-get; I am sure that with the latest version of python3 from apt-get come the latest versions of these packages)
 
For some of these packages that need to be installed/upgraded via pip3, you will have to first uninstall those that have been already installed via apt-get beforehand.
