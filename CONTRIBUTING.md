For now, if you want to know how to setup your environment for testing, please refer to "How to Assemble LaDD" and then "How to Use LaDD" in the wiki.

The types of contributions I am looking for include the following:
* The addition of new features to the software of LaDD (i.e., the code in this repository)
* Making the existing code base smaller and more efficient where possible.
* Coming up with new ideas concerning the hardware of LaDD (e.g., providing blueprints for a plastic case for LaDD, etc.).

What I plan for the project is that this software and anything else tied to it is used as either intended or unintended. I am not sure that this project will make significant leaps and bounds beyond the current code base, but anything can happen. In the meanwhile, my goal is to get the wiki complete so that people know what LaDD is and how to create, use, and possibly contribute to LaDD.

I am not sure currently how to use it, but I am thinking if you have any new ideas or proposals you want to make, there will be a "Project" for it. In the meanwhile, just email me your ideas to my email (nied.kyle@gmail.com).

This file will undergo many changes in the coming months.
