Things needed to be done for LaDD to be truly ready for open source development by the wonderful open source community (according to Kyle, author of LaDD):
 * Record several downfalls and issues with current code.
 * Explain really what LaDD from both a hardware and software standpoint is in either both the repository's wiki and its README.md, or one or the other.
