# LaDD
Abbreviation for "Lane Detection Device," it is the software that would run on a capable device with the same name that would together become a lane-detection and warning system.

You will find all you need to know about LaDD and how to set up LaDD in this repository's wiki.

Note:
Currently, this repository and its wiki are works-in-progress. Although all of the necessary code to run LaDD and helpful files to set it up has been created and uploaded, the wiki is unfinished. It is only a matter of time until I will be able to officially make the first "release" of LaDD. However, until then, you have everything you need to work with LaDD.
