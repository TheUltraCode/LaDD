# LaDD
Abbreviation for "Lane Detection Device," it is the software that would run on a capable device with the same name that would together become a lane-detection and warning system.

You will find all you need to know about LaDD and how to set up LaDD in this repository's wiki.

Note:
Currently, this repository and its wiki are works-in-progress. Although all of the necessary code to run LaDD has been created and uploaded, the wiki is unfinished and some additional, extremely helpful files have not been upload yet. It is only a matter of time until I will be able to officially make the first "release" of LaDD. However, until then, you have everything you need to work with LaDD's software.
